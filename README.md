# integrable-trotterization

This repository contains data and codes associated with the paper "Conserved charges in the quantum simulation of integrable spin chains" by 
Kazunobu Maruyoshi, Takuya Okuda, Juan W. Pedersen, Ryo Suzuki, Masahito Yamazaki, and Yutaka Yoshida.

- MAIN_public.ipynb performs the quantum simulation on a simulator with the circuits described in the paper.
- Use plot_results.ipynb to plot data in the result folders.  Computation of statistical uncertainties is omitted.
- recursion_calc.nb generates files q3_plus_coefficients.dat, ..., q6_plus_coefficients.dat.
